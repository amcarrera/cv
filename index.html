      <p><em>Marketing Data Analyst</em></p>
      <p>I am a recent graduate from <a href="https://www.stjohns.edu/">St. John’s University</a> with a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology and a minor in Business Administration. I was involved in the Filipino Club at my school as the Vice President promoting cultural awareness by organizing events that showcase the Filipino culture. I was also a mentor at the Filipino Intercollegiate Networking Dialogue, Incorporated. As a mentor, I facilitated workshops that empowered young college students to learn about their self-identity and ethnic cultures. Since I have a wide range of experience, I am open to various roles in the technology field. I have an interest in web development, UX/UI, and data analytics. On my free time, I travel to Manhattan, New York and go through the art galleries in Chelsea or art museums such as the New Museum and the Whitney. </p></td>
